# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.


1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

My process was to run one test at a time and try to figure out what was wrong with the code. I didn't use pry or any debugging tool but was able to figure out all the bugs by reading the error message and running multiple tests until I found the solution. I think next time I might save a few minutes by using pry in some situations but ultimately think that just reading the error messages was enough for me to figure out what was wrong with the code. I think running every test by itself also clears a lot of head space so I'm only concentrating on getting one thing passed at a time.


2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?

When you write the code yourself you're already familiar with the whole project and your own personal taste in syntax. I think that just getting familiarized in new code is daunting at first but like most things in coding it's best to just absorb one chunk at a time. I also find that reading everything out loud to be very helpful becuase it makes it easier for me to get some ideas about what's going on in the code out.

3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

I think I'm feeling more comfortable with error messages and figuring out what's wrong at this point so that definitely felt easier than it has the past few weeks.
